First of all, Metago is a tool made for myself, it comes from the voice in my heartüíñas a programmer.
Metago tries its best to be the coolestüòé keyboard(mouseless) focused navigation tool in vscode.
Metago tries to make your keyboard‚å® to you as meaningful as a kitchen knife to a master chefüë©‚Äçüç≥.

<br>
Metago as a free tool, currently is maintained and developed by me in my spare timeüåô‚è≥, if you think has ever saved you time, boosted your efficiency, or even indispensable like some of our users, please support me üòä

## metaJump
<b>metaJump</b> is one part of the tool set <i>MetaGo</i>, with the goal to do cursor moving/selecting/deleting by showing decorators on possible target-locations. **([detail document of MetaJump](https://github.com/metaseed/metaGo/blob/master/src/metaJump/README.md#metajump))**
![MetaGo.MetaJump](src/metaJump/images/metaJump.gif)
## metaSelection


### lines selection
vsCode's default select current line command(`Ctrl+l`) selects current line and puts the cursor at the next line's start position.
we create our own to extend/shrink the selection of the current line:
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>l</kbd> to select current line if no selection at cursor, or extend/shrink selections by one line below if there is selection before/after the cursor.
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> to extend/shrink selection by one line above if there is selection after/before the cursor.

> extend/shrink selections work at the selection's active end(where cursor flashing), if you want to extend/shrink at the selection's anchor end, use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> to alternate selection's anchor with active at first.

> note: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> triggers open file by default, and it triggers extend line selection above only when there is selection in active editor.

> if you want to select line up, you should press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>l</kbd> to select current line and then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> to extend line selection above.

by default selectLineUp command is configured as:
```json
{
    "command": "metaGo.selectLineUp",
    "key": "ctrl+o",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorHasSelection"
}
```
you could assign a shortcut key not collision with default vscode ones, just remove the `editorHasSelection` condition, so it works even with no selection in editor.

### alternate Selection's active with anchor
* <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> to alternate the selection's active(cursor flashing) with the anchor.

[*‚û≠Feature Summary‚Æµ*](https://github.com/metaseed/metaGo/blob/master/README.md#features-summary)
#### lineSelection demo
we use `ctrl+l` to select current line, then `ctrl+l` again to extend current selection below, then `ctrl+o` to shrink current selection above, then `alt+a` to alternate the current selection's active end with anchor end, then `ctrl+o` to extend current selection above, then `ctrl+alt+/` to add another cursor, and `ctrl+l` to select current line, `ctrl+l` again to extend selection below, then `alt+a` to alternate selection's active with anchor, then `ctrl+o` to extend selection above.

With the two selections, you could then delete or copy...

[*‚û≠Feature Summary‚Æµ*](https://github.com/metaseed/metaGo/blob/master/README.md#features-summary)



### surrounding-pair selection
commands to select content inside a pair of separators: '(',')'; '[',']'; '{','}';'<','>'; '>', '<'; or any char pair: ''', '"'...
html tag pair is supported via regexp. (i.e. to select content between two html tag pairs: `alt+shift+p t`, `t` means tag).

* `Alt+p` to chang surrounding pairs.
* `Alt+Shift+p` to select content between surrounding pairs.
* `Alt+Ctrl+p` to select both the content and the pairs.

1. <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>: I want to select content between a pair of chars.
2. type the start character of the pair. i.e. '(', '[', '{', '"'... or the specific regex key(i.e. 't' for html/xml tag)

> Note: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> to selection both the content and the pair of separators.

> it supports multiple cursors/selections

#### surroundPairs config
below is the default surrounding-pairs config, it support regex:
```json
"metaGo.surroundPairs": {
    "type": "object",
    "default":[["{","}"],["(",")"],["[","]"],["<",">"],["/<(?!/)(?!!)(?!br[\\s>])(?!area[\\s>])(?!base[\\s>])(?!col[\\s>])(?!command[\\s>])(?!embed[\\s>])(?!hr[\\s>])(?!img[\\s>])(?!input[\\s>])(?!keygen[\\s>])(?!link[\\s>])(?!meta[\\s>])(?!param[\\s>])(?!source[\\s>])(?!track[\\s>])(?!wbr[\\s>])((?:.(?!/>))+?)(?<!/)>/ms", "/<\/(.+?)>/", "t"]]
},

```
> the last one is and regex, it is used for html tag: this array has 3 items: start html tag regex, end html tag regex, trigger key.
> the default trigger key is the start pair, if start pair is only one char.
> regex is the content inside '/' and '/', is defined by javascript regex grammar
> you could config your own regex pairs
> the regex pairs support all regex flags, which means it support multiline tag.

> html elements is defined in https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html-markup-20110405/syntax.html#syntax-elements

[*‚û≠Feature Summary‚Æµ*](https://github.com/metaseed/metaGo/blob/master/README.md#features-summary)

#### surrounding-pair-selection demo
we use `alt+shift+p (` to select content inside the '(' and ')', then `alt+shift+p {` to extend selection, then `alt+shift+p {` to extend further, then `alt+ctrl+p {` to include then pair('{'and '}') in the selection, then `alt+ctrl+p` to extend the selection further with the pair('{' and '}') included.

[*‚û≠Feature Summary‚Æµ*](https://github.com/metaseed/metaGo/blob/master/README.md#features-summary)

#### surrounding-pair-selection demo: html tag pairs

we use `alt+shift+p t` to select content inside html tag, `alt+ctrl+p` to select both the content and the tag pairs.
if the cursor is in the start or end tag, `alt+shift+p t` would select both the tag and the content.

[*‚û≠Feature Summary‚Æµ*](https://github.com/metaseed/metaGo/blob/master/README.md#features-summary)

#### surrounding-pair changing demo

in this demo, we `alt+p ' "` to change a pair of ' to ", and then goto another place use `alt+p [ (` to change a pair to '[]' to '()'. Then we switch to another html file, where we `alt+p t` to change a surrounding pair of 'h1' to 'h2', and go to another place, to use `alt+p t` to change another pair of tag from 'h3' to 'h1', note: here is a multi-line start-tag, we use `alt+shift+//` to shrink the selection first and then modify the pair of tag.
