**the Goal of MetaWord is providing different kinds of words based cursorMove/Select/Delete commands.**

> **MetaWord is part of [MetaGo extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=metaseed.metago)**

MetaWord as a free tool, currently is maintained and developed by me in my spare time🌙⏳, if you think has ever saved you time, boosted your efficiency, or even indispensable like some of our users, please support me 😊
Give me a  [github⭐](https://github.com/metaseed/metago), or even [sponsor me at github🍻](https://github.com/sponsors/metasong)

## MetaWord
|word type|description|
|---|---|
|SpaceWord(BigWord)| characters separated by 'space'('Space' or 'Tab')|
|Word|a group of alphanumeric character with underscore and (A-Za-z0-9_) or a group of other symbol characters(i.e. ~!@#$%^&*()-+:;"',.<>/?\[]{})|
|WordPart(SmallWord)| a group of spaces, a part in a group of CamelCase (A-Za-z0-9) characters, a part of '_' connected (A-Za-z0-9) characters, or a group of other symbol characters|

* <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd>: delete all from the cursor to the line start.
* <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>del</kbd>: delete all from the cursor to the line end.

### Word commands to moveCursor/select/delete by word

> we use the default vscode 'Word' commands

> **note:**
> default vscode cursorWordEndRight command would do this:
> '|console|.log|(err|)|' and 'a|+=| 3| +5|-3| +| 7|' (if there is only one symbol character before the next word, the cursor would not stop after the symbol)
>
> default vscode cursorWordStartLeft command would do this:
> 'this|.|is|.|a|.|test' and ' text| a|+=| 3| +|5|-|3| +| 7|' (work as expected)
>
> default deleteWordLeft command would do this:
> '|this.|is.|a.|test'(<=star from here, if there is only one symbol character after the previous word, the cursor would not stop and delete it with the previous word together)
> default deleteWordRight command would do this:
> '|this|.|is|.|a|.|test|' (work as expected)


* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>left/right</kbd>: left/right move cursor to word start/end.
* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>left/right</kbd>: left/right select from cursor to word start/end.
* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>backspace/delete</kbd>: left/right delete from cursor to word start/end.
> Note: one Mac, the cursorWord* commands are not mapped, you may need to map them by your self.

### WordPart commands to moveCursor/select/delete by wordPart
> Examples: ABCdef__ghIJKL
> * when forward:
>   * '|AB|Cdef|\_\_gh|IJKL|'
>   * '|AB|Cdef|\_\_ghijkl|'
> * when backward:
>   * '|AB|Cdef\_\_|gh|IJKL|' (<-start from end)
character
> note: the difference at the word connector('_')  dd    dd

* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>left/right</kbd>: move cursor left/right to the wordPart start/end.
* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>left/right</kbd>: left/right select from cursor to the wordPart start/end.
* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd>: left delete to the wordPart start.
* on windows <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd>: right delete to the wordPart end.(note: `ctrl+alt+del` on windows is a system shortcut, we could not use it)
    > on Mac use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>delete</kbd>

### SpaceWord commands to moveCursor/select/delete word separated by space:
* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>left/right</kbd>: move cursor left/right by one space-word and set cursor at the begin/end of the word.
* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>left/right</kbd>: select to left/right by one space-word.
* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd>: delete one space-word left.
* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>del</kbd>: delete one space-word right.

* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>home/end</kbd>: move cursor left/right by one space-word and set cursor at the begin/end of the spaces surrounding the word.
* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>home/end</kbd>: select to left/right by one space-word, spaces before/after the word is selected too.
* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd>: delete one space-word left, spaces before the word are also deleted.
* <kbd>win/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>del</kbd>: delete one space-word right, spaces after the word are also deleted.

## Note
we modified several default command vscode command's shortcut, because we want to use it to do word based cursorMove/select/delete.
* `ctrl+alt+left/right` by default is used by "workbench.action.moveEditorToPreviousGroup/NextGroup", so we assign `ctrl+k ctrl+left/right` to do the editor movement.
* `ctrl+alt+shift+left/right` by default is used by "cursorColumnSelectLeft/Right" command, we think of a solution to do column based vertical selection:
    > <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd>: toggle vertical column selection mode.
    > `alt+v` to enter vertical column selection model, then press `shift+left/right/up/down` as needed to do column mode selection.
